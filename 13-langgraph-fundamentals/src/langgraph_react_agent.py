"""
ReAct Agent with Function Calling — LangGraph Implementation (Chapters 90-97)

This is the FIRST real LangGraph project from Eden's course. It implements the
classic ReAct (Reason + Act) agent loop using LangGraph's graph structure.

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES:
  Takes a user question → LLM reasons about what tools to use → calls tools →
  feeds results back → LLM reasons again → repeats until it has the final answer.

  Example: "What is the temperature in Tokyo? List it and then triple it"
    1. LLM decides: I need to search for Tokyo's temperature → calls TavilySearch
    2. Gets result: "72°F" → feeds back to LLM
    3. LLM decides: I need to triple 72 → calls triple(72)
    4. Gets result: 216.0 → feeds back to LLM
    5. LLM decides: I have everything → returns final answer to user

THE REACT LOOP (this is the entire pattern):
  ┌──────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
  │ agent_reason │────▶│ has tool_calls?│────▶│    tools    │
  │ (LLM thinks) │     │  YES → tools   │     │ (execute)  │
  └──────────────┘     │  NO  → END     │     └─────┬──────┘
        ▲              └───────────────┘            │
        │                                           │
        └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    (CYCLE: back to agent)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - This is the SIMPLEST possible LangGraph agent
  - It demonstrates the exact pattern that 90% of agents follow
  - The cycle (tools → agent → tools → agent) is what makes it an AGENT
  - Without the cycle, it's just a chain (one-directional)

TOOLS USED:
  1. TavilySearch — real-time web search (gets live data like weather)
  2. triple — a simple math tool (demonstrates custom tool creation)

PREREQUISITES:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
  - TAVILY_API_KEY in .env (get free at https://app.tavily.com)

# TOOLS: Define what the agent can DO in the real world.
#
# Each tool is a Python function with:
#   - Type hints (become the schema the LLM sees)
#   - Docstring (becomes the description the LLM reads to decide when to use it)
#
# The LLM does NOT execute these. It only REQUESTS them.
# The ToolNode executes them and returns results.
# =====================================================================

# TavilySearch is a pre-built LangChain tool. max_results=1 keeps it fast.

# MODEL: Initialize the LLM and bind tools to it.
#
# bind_tools() does NOT execute tools. It tells the LLM:
#   "Here are functions you can REQUEST. Include tool_calls in your
#    response if you want me to run them."
#
# The LLM then returns AIMessage with tool_calls=[{name, args, id}]
